# About Natural Languaje Processing (NLP)

Our language is one of the most important data sources to analyze the people, their opinions, feelings, purchase profile, so on. Currently, there are many libraries to analyze it. For me, the best library to start studying this, is NLTK (https://www.nltk.org/). Its book explains what a language is, its components, how to identify its syntax, verify its grammar, how to analyze the structure of sentences, the meaning of sentences and others topics.

The code in this repository contains my notes on the NLTK book and additional exercises for analyzing English text.
