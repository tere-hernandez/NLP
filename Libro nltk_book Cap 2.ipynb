      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "    NLTK corpus readers.  The modules in this package provide functions\n",
      "    that can be used to read corpus fileids in a variety of formats.  These\n",
      "    functions can be used to read both the corpus fileids that are\n",

      "    of external corpora.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Corpus Reader Functions\n",
      "    =======================\n",
      "    Each corpus module defines one or more \"corpus reader functions\",\n",
      "    which can be used to read documents from that corpus.  These functions\n",
      "    take an argument, ``item``, which is used to indicate which document\n",
      "    should be read from the corpus:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    - If ``item`` is one of the unique identifiers listed in the corpus\n",
      "      module's ``items`` variable, then the corresponding document will\n",
      "      be loaded from the NLTK corpus package.\n",
      "    - If ``item`` is a fileid, then that file will be read.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Additionally, corpus reader functions can be given lists of item\n",
      "    names; in which case, they will return a concatenation of the\n",
      "    corresponding documents.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Corpus reader functions are named based on the type of information\n",
      "    they return.  Some common examples, and their return types, are:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    - words(): list of str\n",
      "    - sents(): list of (list of str)\n",
      "    - paras(): list of (list of (list of str))\n",
      "    - tagged_words(): list of (str,str) tuple\n",
      "    - tagged_sents(): list of (list of (str,str))\n",
      "    - tagged_paras(): list of (list of (list of (str,str)))\n",
      "    - chunked_sents(): list of (Tree w/ (str,str) leaves)\n",
      "    - parsed_sents(): list of (Tree with str leaves)\n",
      "    - parsed_paras(): list of (list of (Tree with str leaves))\n",
      "    - xml(): A single xml ElementTree\n",
      "    - raw(): unprocessed corpus contents\n",
      "    \n",
      "    For example, to read a list of the words in the Brown Corpus, use\n",
      "    ``nltk.corpus.brown.words()``:\n",
      "    \n",
